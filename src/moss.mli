val submit : ?userid: string -> ?experimental: bool -> ?comment: string ->
             ?by_dir: bool -> ?max_rep: int -> ?n: int -> lang ->
             ?base: File.t list -> File.t list -> Uri.t
(** [submit lang files] submit the files and return the result from
   MOSS.  If the data from any [File.t] is no longer available,

   @param base Moss normally reports all code that matches in pairs of
   files.  When base files are supplied, program code that also
   appears in any base file is not counted in matches.  A typical base
   file will include, for example, the instructor-supplied code for an
   assignment.  You should use base files if it is convenient; base
   files improve results, but are not usually necessary for obtaining
   useful information.

   @param by_dir specifies that submissions are by directory, not by
   file.  That is, files in a directory are taken to be part of the
   same program, and reported matches are organized accordingly by
   directory.  The directory consists in the path leading to the file
   as given by [Filename.dirname], i.e., "d/e/file1" and "d/f/file2"
   are considered to belong to different programs.  Default: [false].

   @param n determines the number of matching files to show in the
   results.  The default is [250].

   @param max_rep sets the maximum number of times a given passage may
   appear before it is ignored.  A passage of code that appears in
   many programs is probably legitimate sharing and not the result of
   plagiarism.  With [~max_rep], any passage appearing in more than
   [max_rep] programs is treated as if it appeared in a base file
   (i.e., it is never reported).  With [~max_rep:2], moss reports only
   passages that appear in exactly two programs.  If one expects many
   very similar solutions (e.g., the short first assignments typical
   of introductory programming courses) then using [~max_rep:3] or
   [~max_rep:4] is a good way to eliminate all but truly unusual
   matches between programs while still being able to detect 3-way or
   4-way plagiarism.  With [~max_rep:1000000] (or any very large
   number), moss reports all matches, no matter how often they appear.
   The [~max_rep] setting is most useful for large assignments where
   one also a base file expected to hold all legitimately shared code.
   The default for [~max_rep] is [10].

   @param experimental sends queries to the current experimental
   version of the server.  The experimental server has the most recent
   Moss features and is also usually less stable (read: may have more
   bugs).  Default: [false].

   @param userid override the default userid (see {!set_userid}). *)
